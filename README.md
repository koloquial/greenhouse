## About
The goals for Greenhouse are meshed within several of my favorite genres.  Originally Greenhouse
started as a 1v1 RTS - however - I wanted to include aspects of farming, survival and rpg elements
that would make a single match longer than desired. I scratched the project - and started again with 
a focus on a single player experience with multiplayer elements optional and to come later through
factions you are able to join and complete missions on a pvp server.

### Under Construction
Whats available: 
- Generate world
- Click world map tiles to bring up local view

    - (e.g.) Garden, Tent, Campfire, Peasant
    - Find held resources Wood, Seeds
- Move peasant via W,A,S,D keys or by clicking arrow buttons (left side controller)
- Use peasant action buttons via arrow keys or by clicking action buttons (right side controller)

    - If you fell Maple trees, the app will crash.  I have not programmed these fully yet.
